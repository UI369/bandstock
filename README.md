Make sure to allow browser to do "popups" as it will open a new tab. 

There are a few keymappings that change aspects of the 3D display

N: Move the block near

F: Move the block far

O: Switch to orthographic camera

P: Switch to perspective camera

The new tab will show the state machine where NEAR and FAR states can be accessed. (ortho and perspective are not represented as states yet)
